- Gain is how "loud" the signal is _before_ processing
- Volume is how the "loud" the final output signal is

E.g. one might do something like

Gain -> Hard Clipping -> Volume

In this case the gain will potentially increase the impact of the hard clipping,
i.e. signals that may not have been clipped pre-gain will now be clipped. The
final output is then readjusted to a suitable volume.
