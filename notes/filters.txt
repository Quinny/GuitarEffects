Low pass filter - Passes signals with low frequencies, attenuates high frequencies

High pass filter - Passes signals with high frequencies, attenuates low frequencies

Band pass filter - Passes signals with a certain range, attenuates outside the range.
Essentially low pass + high pass.

* attenuates - reduces intensity
