# Guitar Effects Processor

My attempt at building a guitar effects processor. The moonshot goal is
to get this running on a raspberry pi and controllable via a touch screen.

# Building

First clone the repo: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Quinny/GuitarEffects`

Then install rtaudio: `cd rtaudio && ./autogen.sh && make`
